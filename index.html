          <p>
            Backyard Fungi is about creating a hyper-local food economy in the Twin Cities by empowering and educating
            normal people on how they can grow high-quality, local food in their own backyards. It was started by two
            urban dwellers in Minneapolis who were passionate about people having access to a sustainable food source.
            I helped by creating content on their website, and through developing their overall marketing strategy.

            The purpose of semantic elements is to provide helpful information for both web developers and browsers.
            Semantic elements help to define the content that exists on a web page by giving browsers directions for
            how the information should be displayed.Select the link to learn more about Semantic Elements and their
