          <h2>1) Backyard Fungi</h2>
            <a href="https://backyardfungi.com" target="_blank">Link to Backyard Fungi Website</a>
            <p>
              Backyard Fungi is about creating a hyper-local food economy in the Twin Cities by empowering and educating
              normal people on how they can grow high-quality, local food in their own backyards. It was started by two
              urban dwellers in Minneapolis who were passionate about people having access to a sustainable food source.
              I helped by creating content on their website, and through developing their overall marketing strategy.

          <p>
            The purpose of semantic elements is to provide helpful information for both web developers and browsers.
            Semantic elements help to define the content that exists on a web page by giving browsers directions for
            how the information should be displayed.Select the link to learn more about Semantic Elements and their

        <h2>4) Sample Poem</h2>
        <p>
          <br>On the last day of August, I am in the nature preserve
          Across from the apartment building called, “next”
          With lower case letters like that,
          Right off the highway they call “Crosstown.""
          <br>
          It is still and clean here, and I am comfortable,
          Feeling almost nothing but the slightest chill.
          <br>
          I am encircled here by the walking path for outdoor enthusiasts like myself
          Who cannot stand to stair indoors all day.
         <br>
          The wetland is manicured just so to no be a slice of the natural world,
          A dose of coffee here, a dose of fresh air there,
          A parking space assigned and kept for you.
          <br>
          This may be the vision after all,
          A place and slice or sample of every feeling just for you,
          And words to describe it.
          <br>
          Take and eat this slice of life.
          It’s been perfectly prepared
          But without too much sugar
