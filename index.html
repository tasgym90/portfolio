        <p>
          Backyard Fungi is about creating a hyper-local food economy in the Twin Cities by empowering and educating
          normal people on how they can grow high-quality, local food in their own backyards. It was started by two
          urban dwellers in Minneapolis who were passionate about people having access to a sustainable food source.
          I helped by creating content on their website, and through developing their overall marketing strategy.
