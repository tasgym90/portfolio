          <p>
            Backyard Fungi is about creating a hyper-local food economy in the Twin Cities by empowering and educating
            normal people on how they can grow high-quality, local food in their own backyards. It was started by two
            urban dwellers in Minneapolis who were passionate about people having access to a sustainable food source.
            I helped by creating content on their website, and through developing their overall marketing strategy.

          <p>
            The purpose of semantic elements is to provide helpful information for both web developers and browsers.
            Semantic elements help to define the content that exists on a web page by giving browsers directions for
            how the information should be displayed.Select the link to learn more about Semantic Elements and their

        <h3>Sample Poem</h3>
        <p>
          On the last day of August, I am in the nature preserve
          Across from the apartment building called, “next>”
          With lower case letters like that,
          Right off the highway they call “Crosstown.”

          It is still and clean here, and I am comfortable,
          Feeling almost nothing but the slightest chill.

          I am encircled here by the walking path for outdoor enthusiasts like myself
          Who cannot stand to stair indoors all day.

          The wetland is manicured just so to no be a slice of the natural world,
          A dose of coffee here, a dose of fresh air there,
          A parking space assigned and kept for you.

          This may be the vision after all,
          A place and slice or sample of every feeling just for you,
          And words to describe it.

          Take and eat this slice of life.
          It’s been perfectly prepared
          But without too much sugar
